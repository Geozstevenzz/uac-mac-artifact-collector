# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## DEVELOPMENT VERSION

### Highlights

- Amazon S3 output file transfer now supports AWS Signature Version 4 (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256).
- Previously, UAC filtered out non-regular files (e.g., symbolic links, sockets, block special files, etc.) before archiving the collected data. Now, if `file_type` is not specified, UAC will collect both regular files and symbolic links by default.
- You can create files with the operating system name in the `config` directory to **override** the default configuration for a specific operating system. Please check the [documentation](https://tclahr.github.io/uac-docs/config_file/) for more information.
- The shell script [timeout.sh](https://github.com/tclahr/timeout.sh) was added to the `bin` directory. It mimics the traditional Linux `timeout` command and can be used to limit the execution time of a command on all operating systems.
- `--validate-artifact` was updated to verify if `f` is included in the `file_type` when `max_file_type` or `min_file_type` is specified.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the global `max_depth` set in uac.conf was not being respected in some cases. ([#359](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/359))
- Fixed a bug where sftp ssh options were not being set correctly. ([#366](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/366))
- Fixed a bug where the bodyfile artifact was returning corrupted file names when `statx` was being used with `xargs -0`. ([#369](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/369)) (by [halpomeranz](https://github.com/halpomeranz))

### Command Line Option Changes

- `--sftp-ssh-options` is now `--sftp-ssh-option`: This allows setting SSH options as key=value pairs. Can be used multiple times to set multiple options. ([#366](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/366))

### Tools

- All scripts/binaries from the `tools` directory were moved to `bin`.
- `astrings` helper function was improved and is now available as [strings.sh](https://github.com/tclahr/strings.sh) in the `bin` directory.
